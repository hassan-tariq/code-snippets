Taxonomy Columns for Avada Portfolio is a WordPress plugin that enhances the Avada theme's portfolio functionality by adding custom taxonomy columns to the Avada Portfolio post type. It allows users to easily view and manage taxonomy terms associated with portfolio items directly from the WordPress admin panel.
